## Hey, welcome to my corner of the web! ðŸ‘¾

I'm a programmer with a deep passion for building things that work smoothly behind the scenes. 
Currently studying at the University of Computer Science and Engineering in Skopje, Iâ€™m on my way to becoming a backend developer.
Iâ€™ve got a knack for crafting slick frontends with React and making data flow seamlessly with PostgreSQL.
I also thrive in the world of PostgreSQL, making sure data flows like it should.
